You can further filter them by selecting tags (also from the left menu). You can also search by word, translation, author or definition! You can also choose the level of the words you want to learn. If you wish, copy the URL of the web page with all the weird-looking characters and you will be able to share your word list with your friends!</p><p>We also invite you to contribute!

And if we want to have meaningful conversations about this topics, we need to work on our vocabulary.</p><p>We created this Dictionary for people who, just like us, would like to exchange thoughts during WYD and want to improve their language to do so. After many hours of hard work two platforms are ready - the web page for you to look through (and contribute to) the database and an advanced Python script to manage the all the data. Did we mention <a href='https://github.com/World-Youth-Days/Dictionary' target=_blank>it's all on GitHub</a>?</p><p>We hope that you'll find our work useful - and we also hope that you'll consider helping us make it even more awesome!
